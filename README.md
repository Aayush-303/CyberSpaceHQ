🌐 Linux Web Server Project: College Login Page Edition 🎓

Welcome to our groovy Linux Web Server Project! 🚀 This project brings together the power of Linux, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a snazzy web server serving up a college login page. 🖥️💼

Overview:
Our project is a whimsical exploration into the world of web development on the Linux platform. 🐧 We've crafted a nifty web server using C++ to handle all incoming HTTP requests with finesse. 🛠️ But wait, there's more! Our pièce de résistance is the stunning login page, designed using HTML for structure, CSS for style, and JavaScript for interactivity. 💥✨

Project Highlights:

Server.cpp: This file is the heart and soul of our operation. It's where the magic happens! 🪄 Our trusty server.cpp handles all incoming requests, ensuring a smooth user experience for all. 🤹‍♂️
Index.html: Ah, the crown jewel of our project! 🏰 This HTML file brings the college login page to life, inviting users to embark on a journey of knowledge and discovery. 📚🔍
Style.css: Let's not forget about style, darling! 💃 Our style.css file adds flair and pizzazz to our login page, making sure it's dressed to impress. 👗👠
Script.js: Last but certainly not least, our script.js file adds a sprinkle of JavaScript magic to the mix. ✨ From form validation to login requests, it's the secret sauce that ties everything together. 🧙‍♂️🔮
How to Run:
Running our web server is a breeze! Simply follow these funky steps:

Compile the server.cpp file using your favorite C++ compiler. 🛠️
Execute the compiled server executable and watch as it comes to life! 🎬
Open your favorite web browser and navigate to http://localhost:port (don't forget to replace port with the specified port number). 🌐🔍
